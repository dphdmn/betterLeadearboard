## February 29, 2024 Update
Transitioned updates from hourly to every 6 hours to reduce GitHub spam and minimize annoyance. There wasn't significant necessity for frequent updates initially. Considering a potential shift to 24-hour intervals later, but for now, 6 hours seems optimal.

## April 7, 2024 Update
Performed repository cleanup to manage the burgeoning size (3 Gb for 6 months), primarily attributed to hourly updates before March. With the adjustment to 6-hour intervals, repository growth is now more manageable. 

Backups spanning November 2023 to April 2024 (excluding solve data) are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dzUc0bwpY4PUppNLjEXhW1WWHCu7CL-V/view?usp=sharing). Solve data backups were not retained due to laziness.

To view backups, clone the repository locally, replace the backup file as "data/leaderboard.json", and run it on your server.

Considering adding a button for loading older leaderboard data from a file, but, well, laziness persists.
