## New project - Slidysim Session Tracker
Hey, do you like slidysim? You have found this page? Check this! https://github.com/dphdmn/slidysimSessionTracker

## Update - February 29, 2024
Changed update frequency from hourly to every 6 hours to reduce GitHub spam and annoyance. Considering a potential shift to 24-hour intervals later, but for now, 6 hours seems best.

## Update - April 7, 2024
Performed cleanup on the repository to manage its size (reached 3 GB for 6 months), mainly due to hourly updates before March. With the switch to 6-hour intervals, repository growth is now more manageable.

Backups spanning November 2023 to April 2024 (excluding solve data) are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dzUc0bwpY4PUppNLjEXhW1WWHCu7CL-V/view?usp=sharing). Solve data backups were not kept due to laziness.

To view backups, clone the repository locally, replace the backup file as "data/leaderboard.json", and run it on your server.

Considering adding a button for loading older leaderboard data from a file, but, well, laziness persists.

## Update - April 16, 2024
v.1.1.0 - You can now [submit your youtube videos to leaderboard](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd14jEa6wVTrRkgiuEBKdC8nvdU4JjRfVuOIuPTtkl1zzzKxA/viewform).

## Update - April 21, 2024
Had some issues with loading github pages. Cleaned the history. Should not really affect anyone.
Update: the issue is likely to the github pages IPs being blocked. 
You may have troubles with loading the site from Russia. Sorry.

## Update - April 22, 2024
v1.2.0 - Fixed some issues with replay, added more different issues.

But actually implemented custom movetimes feature.

Example:

- Click on 4x4 single 1.125 PB by me (dphdmn);
- Enter custom movetimes as ``0, 7, 37, 67, 97, 127, 127, 188, 195, 225, 262, 345, 381, 467, 471, 487, 501, 526, 555, 592, 616, 742, 802, 831, 891, 915, 921, 968, 1005, 1019, 1027, 1057, 1125, 1125``
- Watch the replay with correct timings!
- It is very basic, no checks are being done, nothing is being saved, you have to input stuff manually, and you have to re-enter everything again when changing settings or closing replay.

## Update - April 24, 2024
v1.3.0 - Replay links now support moveTimes [For example, check this!](https://github.com/dphdmn/getLatestSolve/tree/main)
