# 29.02.2024 note

Changed update from 1 per hour to 1 per 6 hours to make it spam less on github and to stop it from annoying constantly. 
Besides, there was not much reason to update it very often in the first place.
Might change to 1/24 hours later, but I hope 1/6 hours would be optimal.

Cleaned the repo. I'll probably be doing that from time to time, because leaderboard data is very large.

You can find backups for November 2023 - April 2024 (first days of the month, no solve data) [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dzUc0bwpY4PUppNLjEXhW1WWHCu7CL-V/view?usp=sharing)

I did not keep backups of solve data because I'm lazy.

You can view backups by clonning the repo locally and replacing the backup file as "leaderboard.json".
